== ABOUT ARCADE BASIC ==

Create a truly unique design with Arcade, a lightweight and fully responsive HTML5 theme. Use the theme customizer to add your own header image, page layout, site width and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats, such as: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Install JetPack to display each of your galleries through a tiled view and jQuery carousel. Compatible with bbPress, BuddyPress, WPML & Woocommerce. Uses Google Fonts for improved typeface readability and works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices.

== NOTES ==

* If you have a drop down list for your site navigation, the parent item should only be a grouping title with a "#" value for the URL parameter. The Bootstrap navbar requires a click to open the drop down list so any link that is set in the parent item will not work.
* The four boxes on the home page are Icon & Text widgets added to the Home Page Top Area.
